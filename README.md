# Salary Prediction 

In this simple project, I have used simple linear regression to predict salary based on years of experience of employees.

I have just started with my Data Science Journey and this is my first simple project in it!.

## Simple Linear Regression
With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients.

This requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as means, standard deviations, correlations and covariance. All of the data must be available to traverse and calculate statistics.

This is fun as an exercise in excel, but not really useful in practice.
